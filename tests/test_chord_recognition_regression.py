"""
Baseline regression test for the live inference path (cli.py -> chord_recognition.py).

This is the P0 accuracy gate for the inference-only enforcement campaign: chord
recognition output on a fixed test clip must stay byte-identical across
refactors that are supposed to be behavior-preserving (dead-code removal,
dependency pruning, etc.).

Device handling is deliberately NOT hardcoded here. lv_chordia auto-selects
CUDA when available (see network.py); that selection logic is untouched
and GPU support is fully preserved. This test forces CPU only through the
package's normal, external mechanism -- the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment
variable, applied to a subprocess -- so it never depends on import order and
never edits/monkeypatches the source's device-selection code. On a machine
where the GPU is unavailable or busy, this still exercises the exact same
code path the CLI uses in production; it just runs on CPU as the fallback
that already exists in network.py. (An explicit `--device cpu` /
`device='cpu'` override also exists now -- see test_device_selection.py --
but this test intentionally keeps exercising the external
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES path, since that's what's known to be
byte-identical to the golden fixture.)

The golden fixture (tests/fixtures/expected_chords_yellow.json) was captured
against test_data/yellow.wav (already tracked in this repo) using the
"submission" chord dictionary. It was verified deterministic across two
consecutive CPU runs and, separately, identical to a GPU run on the same
clip (see the campaign's final report for the GPU comparison -- GPU-path
verification in CI is deferred until a GPU runner is available).
