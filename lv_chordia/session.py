"""
Load-once lifecycle facade for chord recognition.

LVChordiaSession loads the five-model ChordNet ensemble exactly once (at
load(), for a resolved device) and reuses it across infer() calls -- the API
for callers that keep a process resident and recognize chords repeatedly
(e.g. a long-running provider service). The chord dictionary stays a per-call
choice: it only drives the HMM decoder built inside recognize_with_ensemble(),
never the ensemble load, so one loaded session serves any chord vocabulary.
release() drops the ensemble references; close() ends the session for good.
The one-shot chord_recognition() remains the throwaway-ensemble convenience
path.
