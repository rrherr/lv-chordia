lv-chordia package root: version metadata and the inference-only public surface.

A Python package for chord recognition and transcription from audio files,
based on the ISMIR 2019 paper by Junyan Jiang, Ke Chen, Wei Li, and Gus Xia
(https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000078.pdf). This package provides
state-of-the-art chord recognition capabilities with support for extensive
chord vocabularies including complex jazz chords. Inference-only: no
training/eval module is imported here, and import errors are not swallowed
(see chord_recognition.py for the actual entry point chain).

Reads: chord_recognition.py, extractors/__init__.py, mir/__init__.py
